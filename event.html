                Healthy living...

I overheard someone say, watch what people eat and you‚Äôll know who loves yourself. I pondered deeply on this. I remembered how I woofed down three doughnuts and a Coca-Cola a day back, eating chocolate and Fanta the next dayüò≠ without no care in the world.

I asked myself, ‚Äúdoes it mean I don‚Äôt like myself??‚Äù But I‚Äôve been eating healthy all these while, why didn‚Äôt I stick to it?‚Äù I felt very guilty and promised to do better. Imagine if I were a student, snacking on these daily, thinking I‚Äôm eating cheap and helping myself. Goodness!!

Please don‚Äôt be like me. I love me and we should all love ourselves by eating healthy. Do you know how many calories I‚Äôm going to burn? The cheap healthy diet I‚Äôm going to be on without starving myself?... 

Yes, we all can eat healthily and it‚Äôs not quite expensive as we think them to be, I used to think so till I got to know better. You too can be in the know like me and be on the right path to Healthy living.

              <!-- Schooling is a good foundation for success but there are
              experinces, skillsets ect, which are more important and mandatory
              as the can decide either your success or failure, It happend that
              our traditional schools doesn't cover those experinces in her
              curriculum. Therefore let's expand the four walls of our classroom
